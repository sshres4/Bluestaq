Some steps we can take to solve the timeouts and long query times are below:

Step 1: Analyze Long-Running Queries
Use built-in functions to identify which queries are running long. Utilize query execution plans to see detailed execution steps.
For example, if the Books entity is frequently queried based on the Title field, creating an index on the Title field will help improve performance.

Step 2: Optimize Queries
Besides creating indexes, rewrite inefficient queries using various methods. For example, use the WHERE clause to filter data, avoid using SELECT *, and select only the necessary fields.

Step 3: Implement Table Partitioning
Partition the Books table based on a column that logically divides the data, such as YearPublished (e.g., 2000, 2010, 2020).

Step 4: Archive Old Data
Consider archiving books that have not been borrowed in a long time. Create a stored procedure to insert these books into a new Book_Archive table and delete the data from the Books table.

Step 5: Monitor Database Performance
Use tools like Grafana to visualize database metrics, create alerts, and monitor performance.

Step 6: Consider Hardware Upgrades
If performance issues persist after the above steps and monitoring shows consistently high CPU usage, consider upgrading the hardware.
