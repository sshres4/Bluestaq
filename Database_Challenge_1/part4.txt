Some steps we can take to solve the timeouts and long query times are below:

1. We can create indexes on the columns that are frequently queried, such as Title, ISBN, YearPublished, and Genre.
2. We can also partition the book table based on a column that logically divides the data, such as YearPublished (e.g., 2000, 2010, 2020).
3. We can ensure the queries are optimized by using WHERE clauses to filter the data. We should avoid using SELECT * and only select the necessary columns.
4. We may consider archiving books that have not been borrowed in a long time. We can create a stored procedure to insert these books into a new Book_Archive table and delete the data from the Book table.
5. We can also consider upgrading the hardware, such as increasing memory and CPU resources.
6. We can consider creating materialized views (if supported). For example, we could provide an option to query popular authors, where the data is stored in a materialized view.
